				<h1>Banking Your Way</h1>
				<p>At ABC Bank, making banking easier is our top priority. And what could be easier than building your own account that&rsquo;s customized for the way you like to bank! Just select the features you&rsquo;ll use and disregard those you won&rsquo;t.</p>
				<p>XXXXXX account starts with a base monthly service charge and depending upon your selection, there may be no cost at all. Open your account today with as little as $100.</p>

				<p><strong>How to avoid monthly service charge:</strong> Will you have a monthly direct deposit of $500 or more <strong>or</strong> will you use your debit card 30 times a month? If so, you&rsquo;ll easily avoid the $8 monthly service charge.<i class="serviceCharge"></i></p>
				<a class="no">No</a>
				<a class="yes">Yes</a>
			</section>
			<!-- Avoid montly service -->
			<section class="monthlyService">
				<h2>You can avoid the monthly service charge at any time!</h2>
				<p>Keep in mind that in any given month if you have a $500 direct deposit, <strong>or</strong> by using your debit card 30 times in a calendar month your monthly service charge will be waived. The number of debit card transactions is at the account level. If you add a joint account holder and both have debit cards, it&rsquo;s the total transactions between both cards. Example: Monday morning you need gas and run inside for coffee. That is 2 transactions!</p>
